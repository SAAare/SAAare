- 👋 Hi, I’m @SAAare AKA Sass Albert Aare
- 👀 I’m interested in anything and everything, mostly C and python and projects relating to video files and low-level stuff, special interest also in datasec specifically on linux and embedded platforms
- 🌱 Dropped out of Computer Engineering at University of Tartu due to burnout and now back a year later more motivated than ever and engaging in self learning 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects and be a full member of the open source community as i truly believe in it
- 📫 How to reach me: well a message through here is welcome if you want any help
